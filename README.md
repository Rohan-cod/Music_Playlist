## Steps to get the Oauth Token from Spotify
  * Login to your [Spotify account](https://www.spotify.com/us/account/overview/) and get your username.

  * Now download the **json file** by clicking on the download symbol next to your client ID.
  * Copy the contents of the json file and paste it inside the client_secret.json file in your projects folder.
